Smart Obstacle Detection & Collision Avoidance Robot System

## Objective
To design a robot that can move autonomously while detecting and avoiding obstacles in its path using sensors.

## Components / Tools
- Arduino UNO R3
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- DC motors with motor driver (L298N)
- Chassis and wheels
- Jumper wires and battery
- Breadboard (optional)

## Features
- Detects obstacles using ultrasonic sensors
- Avoids collisions by changing direction automatically
- Demonstrates basic robotic motion control
- Ideal for learning embedded systems and sensor integration

## How it Works
1. Ultrasonic sensor detects distance from obstacles.
2. Arduino processes the distance data.
3. Robot changes direction to avoid collision when obstacle is detected.
